# VS Code Azure Resource Manager Snippets

##This extension is now deprecated and will be removed soon. The snippets have all been integrated into the [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools). Please move to this extension to get the latest snippets.


This extension adds snippets to Visual Studio Code for creating Azure Resource Manager Templates. These snippets are taken from the [Cross Platform Tooling Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-arm-tooling).
